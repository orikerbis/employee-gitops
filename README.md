GitOps Repository for Development Environment

Welcome to the GitOps Repository, dedicated to managing and maintaining infrastructure and application configurations across multiple environments, with a primary focus on the Development Environment. This repository adheres to GitOps principles to provide a consistent and automated approach to deployment and configuration management.

Purpose
	•	Environment Management: Centrally manage configurations for dev, test, and prod environments.
	•	Focus on Development: Streamline workflows and configurations specific to the dev environment, empowering developers with a stable, reproducible setup.

The repository is organized as follows:

├── application.yaml               # Global application configurations
└── environments                   # Environment-specific configurations
    ├── dev                        # Development environment
    │   └── values.yaml            # Configuration values for development
    ├── prod                       # Production environment
    │   └── values.yaml            # Configuration values for production
    └── test                       # Testing environment
        └── values.yaml            # Configuration values for testing

File Descriptions
	•	application.yaml: Defines global application settings that apply across all environments.
	•	environments/: Contains directories for each environment (dev, test, prod), each with its own values.yaml file to define environment-specific settings.

Key Features
	•	Environment-Specific Configurations: Separate directories for dev, test, and prod ensure each environment is isolated and independently configurable.
	•	Scalable Design: Easily extendable to support additional environments or services.
	•	Automated Workflows: Designed to integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments and updates.
